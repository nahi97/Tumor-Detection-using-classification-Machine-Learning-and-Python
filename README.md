# Tumor Detection using Classification Machine Learning and Python

## Project Objectives
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify tumors as malignant or benign based on the given dataset. This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms and the comparative analysis of their performance.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)), which is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Libraries Used
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Notebooks
### 1. Breast Cancer.ipynb
This notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation using various classification algorithms

### 2. Cancer.ipynb
This notebook covers:
- Further analysis and visualization of the dataset
- Advanced model tuning and optimization
- Comparative analysis of model performance

## How to Navigate
Each notebook is designed to be self-contained and follows a logical progression from data loading and preprocessing to model evaluation. Follow the steps in each notebook sequentially to understand the complete workflow.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.
3. **Model Training**: Using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of proper data preprocessing and the use of multiple machine learning algorithms to achieve robust and accurate tumor classification. By following the detailed steps in the notebooks, users can gain a comprehensive understanding of the process involved in developing a machine learning model for tumor detection.
